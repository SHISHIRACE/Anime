            The protagonists of the Naruto series are Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno, and Kakashi Hatake, who form "Team 7" (第7班, Dainanahan) of Konohagakure. After Sasuke Uchiha's defection and Naruto's departure from Konohagakure at the end of Part I, the team disbands. During Part II, the team reforms as "Team Kakashi" (カカシ班, Kakashi-Han) with two new members: Sai, who occupies Sasuke's position, and Yamato, who becomes the acting Captain.[ch. 285] During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Team 7 reunites to fight Madara Uchiha who later becomes Kaguya Ōtsutsuki. Once the War is over, Naruto and Sasuke have their final battle. After the fight ends, Team 7 is finally reunited permanently.

            Uzumaki Naruto is the title character and main protagonist of the franchise. He was the first character created by Kishimoto during the conception of the series and was designed with many traits from other shōnen characters. He is often shunned by the Konohagakure villagers, as he is the host of Kurama, the Nine-Tailed Fox that attacked Konoha. He became a ninja after training hard in the Ninja Academy, learning ninjutsu and taijutsu skills, and compensates for this with his cheerful and boisterous personality as he developed his catchphrase "Believe it!" (～だってばよ, dattebayo), vowing to never give up on any goal he sets. In particular, Naruto has ambitions of becoming Hokage, the strongest ninja leader of Konohagakure, to gain the villagers' respect and be able to protect them. During a battle as a ninja, Naruto has mastered powerful various ninjutsu skills and abilities including the ability to create a massive and several clones of himself known as "Shadow Clone Jutsu", the ability to use his wind nature as he's able to master a powerful spiral chakra sphere known as the "Rasengan" for the purposes of the offense, and other numerous abilities like using Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra that increases his speed, strength, agility, and even whenever Naruto was enraged and goes feral but later in Part II he manage to control the Nine Tails' chakra. Over the course of the series, Naruto befriends many foreign and Konoha people and eventually claims a sizable positive impact on their lives, which grants him worldwide fame. Naruto eventually achieves his dream of becoming Hokage, marries Hinata Hyuga and has two children named Boruto Uzumaki and Himawari Uzumaki

            Uchiha Sasuke is Naruto's rival. He was designed by Kishimoto as the "cool genius" since he felt this was an integral part of an ideal rivalry. Sasuke's older brother, Itachi Uchiha, killed the rest of their family. Because of this, Sasuke's sole desire is to kill his brother, and he develops a cold and withdrawn personality, seeing people as tools to further his goals, although also gaining the affection of most of the girls he knows, much to his annoyance. After he becomes a member of Team 7, Sasuke seems to begin considering his teammates precious to the point of risking his life to protect them, while focusing on revenge less than at the start of the series. When during the battle, Sasuke is a taijutsu expert and has mastered his ability to manipulate numerous fire techniques including known as "Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu", manipulating a fury of lightning known as "Chidori" and as a member of the Uchiha clan, he uses the Sharingan that allows him to senses the opponent's moves and attacks. Following an encounter and a subsequent defeat at the hands of his brother in Part I, however, Sasuke severs his ties and leaves the village to seek more power from Orochimaru. By the events of the Boruto franchise, Sasuke has become a vigilante investigating the Otsutsuki clan for Konohagakure.

            Haruno Sakura is a member of Team 7. While creating the character, Kishimoto has admitted that he had little perception of what an ideal girl should be like. As a child, Sakura was teased by other children because of her large forehead, a feature Kishimoto tried to emphasize in Sakura's appearance. She was comforted by Ino Yamanaka and the two developed a friendship. However, as the two grew, they became increasingly distant due to their shared affection for Sasuke Uchiha. As a kunoichi, Sakura possesses superier strength to unleash her powerful punch towards the opponents when she is enraged by saying "Cha!" (しゃーんなろー!, Shānnarō!) and as a medical ninja, she can heal every wounds whenever they are injured. During the early moments of Part I, Sakura is infatuated with Sasuke and resents Naruto Uzumaki, although Sasuke views her as "annoying" and Naruto has feelings for her.[ch. 3] Her perception on Naruto eventually changes, however, and she comes to see him as a friend, while her feelings for Sasuke grow into deep love.

            Kakashi Hatake is the easygoing, smart leader of team 7, consisting of Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. Kakashi had a dark past, but is unaffected by it as an adult. He was a very vital key for Naruto's success, training him to be a great ninja. Like Sasuke, Kakashi is also a master of the Sharingan, which he gained as a present from his late friend, Obito Uchiha, and can manipulate "Lightning Blade" similar to Sasuke's Chidori. Kakashi's original eye was restored late into part 2 of the series. Kakashi is killed by Nagato, who later repents and revives him. Kakashi succeeds Tsunade as the sixth Hokage in the late parts of Naruto Shippuden.
