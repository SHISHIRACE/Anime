               <p> The Big Three was a term used to describe the three most popular running series during their golden age in Jump's mid 2000s period - One Piece, Naruto and Bleach.</p>

        <font color ="white"><h1>The nickname "The Big Three" came about due to their immense worldwide popularity and length. With that, they were always featured in front of the shared Shonen Jump covers and always had bigger images for their main protagonists: Luffy, Naruto and Ichigo.

            While the three series weren't the biggest sellers in the magazine, Hunter x Hunter sold more per volume than Bleach for example, they kept their position on the covers due to their overall popularity.
            
            These three manga have each received long running anime series, Bleach has 366 episodes, Naruto (+Shippuden) has 720 episodes, and One Piece has 1000 episodes as of November 2021, with One Piece and Boruto, Naruto Shippuden's sequel, still airing. These statistics do not include the spin-offs, sequels, and movies, so the full numbers for entire franchises are higher.
            
            All three are shonen series, which usually focus on topics such as adventure, growth, and action. This genre normally has a lot of subplots and one main, overarching plot. Fighting is also a main part of most shonen series: the protagonists almost always have a superpower and are very muscle headed in nature.</h1></font></body></a>
