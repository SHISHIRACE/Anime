            Kurosaki Ichigo is the main protagonist of the series. A tall orange-haired high school student, Ichigo becomes a "substitute Soul Reaper" after unintentionally absorbing most of Rukia Kuchiki's powers. His cynical nature at first makes him ill-disposed towards the duty, but, with the passage of time, he accepts and welcomes the strength his Soul Reaper powers give him. When creating the manga series, Kubo commented that Rukia Kuchiki, the first character he created, did not seem like a lead character, so he created Ichigo to be the series protagonist.

            Kuchiki Rukia is a Soul Reaper, (shinigami) literally 'Death God, who is assigned hollow extermination duties in Karakura Town. She meets Ichigo for the first time when she breaks into his house, not knowing that he can see her. Their relationship further complicates when Rukia saves Ichigo and transfers her powers to him. Rukia lacks it and cannot return to the Soul Society. She assumes a temporary lifestyle as a regular human, using a gigai (human form) obtained from Kisuke Urahara's shop, and enrolls into Ichigo's high school and takes up residence in his closet, while teaching him how to be a substitute Soul Reaper in her place. Rukia was the first female character of the series created by Kubo, her design being the one he decided to use for all the other Soul Reapers

            Inoue Orihime is a long-time classmate of Ichigo and one of his closest friends. She used to have a crush on Ichigo since the beginning, however due to Ichigo's selfless wish to protect his loved ones, Orihime genuinely falls in love with him. Since the age of three, she had been an orphan when her older brother Sora left their abusive parents' home with her and raised her on his own. Later on, when Orihime was in middle school, he died in an accident. Though initially devoid of spiritual powers, she develops spiritual awareness early in the plot and later obtains the god-like ability to warp reality through rejecting past phenomena.

            Abarai Renji, is a Soul Reaper of Squad 6 in the Gotei 13. When he was first introduced he played an antagonistic role as he was sent to the human world to find and bring Rukia back to the Soul Society. He initially dedicates his life to defeating Ichigo, before joining forces with him to rescue Rukia halfway through the Soul Society arc. He has since become a major protagonist and a consistent ally and rival of Kurosaki. His weapon throughout the series is Zabimaru.

            Ishida Uryū is a Quincy, a descendant of a line of near-extinct, priest-like, hollow-hunting archers, who were historical enemies of the Soul Reapers. He bears a deep grudge against all Soul Reapers, including Ichigo, and is an early antagonist in the series. He comes to view Ichigo differently over time, and eventually becomes a valuable ally and a friendly rival. As a Quincy, Uryū possesses the supernatural power to gather invisible "spirit particles" called reishi from the atmosphere. Once gathered, these particles can be shaped into spirit-energy constructs, foremost among them a bow and arrow,[16] and to fuel various magical spells and superhuman abilities.

            Sado Yasutora), better known as Chad, is one of Ichigo's friends at school. He is of mixed Japanese/Mexican heritage and a student who towers over his classmates at 6 feet 5 inches.[17] Despite his imposing appearance and fearless attitude he is quite meek and refuses to fight unless it is for the sake of another. When he attempts to protect Ichigo's sister Karin and her friends from a hollow, he discovers a unique ability that strengthens and armors his right arm, enabling him to fight hollows. He is quite loyal to his friends, especially Ichigo, who is one of his closest friends. He displays little emotion except when something or someone he cares about is in danger.
